# Venapp - "VENdorselectAPP"


This platform is designed for manufacturing companies to purchase raw materials and consumables. 
Store managing staff members will be entering the buying materials information like Material Name, Quantity, Specifications, Vendor, etc.. into a portal,
which they can then edit or delete as needed until the Head of the Department approves the quotation for purchasing materials. Once approved, staff can print the document and send it to the vendor.
Subsequent budget inquiries will be handled through respective emails or phone calls.
